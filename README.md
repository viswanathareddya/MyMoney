# MyMoney
‘MyMoney’,  a platform that lets investors track their consolidated portfolio value across equity, debt, and gold.  Portfolio rebalancing is an activity done to reduce the gains from one asset class and investing them in another, to ensure that the desired weight for each asset class doesn't deviate because of market gains/losses.
